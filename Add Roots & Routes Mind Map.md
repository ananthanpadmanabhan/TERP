      [cite_start]Experiential Suggestions: Travellers receive suggestions to explore traditional practices like coir making, Aranmula mirror crafting, handloom weaving, or organic farm stays [cite: 30]
      Snapshots
        [cite_start]Options for the tourist to choose their destinations (Figure 1) [cite: 32]
        [cite_start]Selecting three destinations, in this case, Wayanad, Thekkady, and Varkala, the tourist can click on “Generate route map” (Figure 2) [cite: 33]
        [cite_start]The portal will provide a list of pre-approved and pre-verified local businesses (Figure 3) [cite: 34]
        [cite_start]Along with the list, a curated map with businesses marked for their convenient travel (in this picture, the businesses are not marked; this is only a preliminary sample.) (Figure 4) [cite: 35]

      [cite_start]Interested businesses, collectives, and homestays are invited to submit their information [cite: 38]
      [cite_start]A field team (in collaboration with local tourism offices or accredited agencies) will physically verify each applicant to ensure authenticity and quality [cite: 39]
      [cite_start]Once verified, they will be geo-tagged and featured on the travel route platform [cite: 40]

    [cite_start]Conclusion [cite: 58]
      [cite_start]Roots & Routes is more than a digital tool; it is a platform for Kerala’s untold stories, forgotten skills, and grassroots entrepreneurship [cite: 59]
      [cite_start]By helping travellers discover Kerala’s true roots through curated routes, we ensure tourism becomes a tool for preservation, empowerment, and sustainable development [cite: 60]
      [cite_start]We look forward to partnering with the Kerala Tourism Department to bring this vision to life [cite: 61]

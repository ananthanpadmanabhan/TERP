    Introduction
      Celebrated for natural beauty, cultural richness, hospitality
      Mainstream circuits often overlook deeply rooted practices, communities, and entrepreneurs
      Transforms tourism to be responsible, inclusive, experiential
      Supports local livelihoods, especially women-led and indigenous enterprises
    Project Vision (Digital Matchmaking Platform)
      Connects travellers with authentic, underrepresented local experiences and businesses
      Aims to
        Promote community-based tourism and cultural preservation
        Offer curated route map based on selected destinations
        Feature verified, women-led and local SMEs (traditional crafts, eco-stays, sustainable food, wellness, etc.)
        Encourage equitable economic growth within Kerala’s tourism economy
    How It Works
      Traveller Portal: Users select desired destinations across Kerala from a list of options
      Route Generation: The system creates a travel route with optimized logistics
      SME Integration: Verified local businesses that lie along or near the route are highlighted with detailed profiles (photos, stories, services)
      Experiential Suggestions: Travellers receive suggestions to explore traditional practices like coir making, Aranmula mirror crafting, handloom weaving, or organic farm stays

        Selecting three destinations, in this case, Wayanad, Thekkady, and Varkala, the tourist can click on “Generate route map” (Figure 2)
        The portal will provide a list of pre-approved and pre-verified local businesses (Figure 3)
        Along with the list, a curated map with businesses marked for their convenient travel (in this picture, the businesses are not marked; this is only a preliminary sample.) (Figure 4)

      Once verified, they will be geo-tagged and featured on the travel route platform
